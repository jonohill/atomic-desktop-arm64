# Purpose

This repository builds the Atomic AlmaLinux base images. It takes the official
[AlmaLinux bootc images](https://github.com/AlmaLinux/bootc-images), adds a basic
desktop environment and smooths out some kinks.

These images are the perfect base from which you can build your own Atomic AlmaLinux respin!
To make this easier, we've created [a template repository](https://github.com/new?template_name=atomic-respin-template&template_owner=AlmaLinux)
to get you started. Create your own Atomic AlmaLinux respin in minutes!

# Contributing

We welcome contributions to all parts of the AlmaLinux project. If you'd like to get involved, please feel free to reach out through [the chat](https://chat.almalinux.org/almalinux/channels/sigatomic)!

## Contributing - Code and Design

Before submitting code changes, please check if there are any open issues or pull requests that cover your proposal. If not, open an issue with a brief description and so you can discuss it with us first. This helps avoid duplicated work and ensures proposed changes align with project goals. This can be your anticipated workflow:

- Create an issue describing your changes.
- Await confirmation from contributors.
- Fork the project.
- Create a new branch for your feature or bug fix.
- Add your code, documentation, etc.
- Submit a pull request (PR). All PRs should target the `main` branch.

After review and approval, the changes will be merged and deployed.

## Reporting a Bug

If you find a bug, please report it [here](https://github.com/AlmaLinux/atomic-desktop/issues)!

## Requesting a Feature

2. If no similar request exists, open a new issue. Please clearly explain why the feature is needed and provide a detailed use case.

## Change Approval Process
